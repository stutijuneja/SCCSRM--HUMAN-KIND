# SCCSRM--HUMAN-KIND

I built a website using HTML and CSS, which is a clone of the Humankind.art website. My website is not responsive,I understand the importance of responsive design, and I plan on incorporating this into my projects.
I have also uploaded the working video of my website. 

Credits
The original website design and content was created by the team at humankind.art.

This cloned website was created by Stuti, based on the original design by humankind.art.
